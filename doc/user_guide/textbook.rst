=================

The astroML package is used to create all of the examples and figures in the
book **Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy**,
by Zeljko Ivezic, Andrew Connolly, Jacob Vanderplas, and Alex Gray,
to be published in 2013 by Princeton University Press.
These figures can be seen in the :ref:`book_fig_root` section, along with
the full Python scripts used to generate them.

The text contains detailed theoretical background of many of the
tools and methods available in astroML, and also many of the tools
available in `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org>`_
which are used in the examples here. The on-line documentation at this site
is growing, but we recommend refering to the text for more details.
