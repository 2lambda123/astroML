AstroML Code
============
The code used to generate the figures in this book can be found at the link 
below. This is a pre-release, and should not be circulated.
No installation is required; simply unpack the tarball
and make sure the directory is in your python path.  These instructions
will be updated before publication.  In the mean time, if you have
issues with the code please email vanderplas@astro.washington.edu.
